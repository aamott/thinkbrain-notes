# UI Development

Implement UI using utilities by default while extracting only meaningful, reusable product concepts.

## Workflow

1. Inspect nearby components, `packages/ui/src/components/ui`, and theme tokens before adding a new pattern.
2. Keep local layout and styling in JSX. Use semantic tokens and mobile-first utilities; order classes layout, spacing, typography, color, then state.
3. Extract a React component only when markup, behavior, and styling recur as a meaningful UI concept across files. Do not extract utility-only wrappers.
4. Give reusable components a small public API. Use `cva` for stable visual variants and `cn` for conditional classes; avoid conflicting overrides.
5. Promote values repeated in multiple places to a theme token or component variant. Keep arbitrary values for genuine one-offs.
6. Use CSS only for theme/base rules, third-party markup, or a selector that utilities cannot express clearly. Do not use `@apply` for ordinary app UI.

## Quality bar

- Preserve keyboard, focus, disabled, loading, error, and dark-theme behavior.
- Test the smallest screen first, then add breakpoints only for needed changes.
- Add brief comments only for non-obvious design constraints or behavior.
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` (or `./scripts/qa.sh`) for UI changes.
